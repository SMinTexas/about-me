	<h1>My Scale Models</h1>
	<p>I have been building scale models, mostly airplanes, since I was three years old.  I have built pretty much anything that one can build, from war planes and tanks to battleships and X-Wing star fighters.  I quit building when baseball and girls drew my attention in junior high and high school, but the itch to build never really left me. At Texas A&M, I actually found the time to put together a couple of model airplanes with some inspiration provided by the movie Top Gun.  A few years after I graduated from A&M, I found myself in a store where I was shopping for something else, when I found a selection of kits including a British Beaufighter, a gorgeous airplane that I had never before built.  That was it.  So in 1995, I restarted in this hobby, and have not really slowed down ever since.</p>
	<p>Back in 2015, I donated three airplanes to a scale model gallery that is located aboard the U.S.S. Lexington Museum in Corpus Christi, Texas.</p>
